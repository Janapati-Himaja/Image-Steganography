# Image-Steganography
Steganography is the practice of hiding a secret message which can be text or non-text files in non-text files like images. It preserves the integrity of a secret file so that apart from the desired receiver, no one else can know its presence. The objective of steganography is to maintain secret communication between individuals. In this Image Steganography, we aim to conceal the data into an image file by encoding and revealing it by decoding.

This GUI-based Python project uses Tkinter, PIL modules and the Least Significant Bit (LSB) algorithm. The least significant bit insertion is a standard and straightforward method to embed data in an image file. Tkinter uses the Python Pillow(PIL) package for image processing capabilities. Here we create a window with 2 buttons: Encode and Decode. It takes the image in which the secret message is to be encoded and the secret message as input. We are provided with an output of an encrypted image. Using the decode option, the desired receiver can decode it.
